# Zero Trust Frontend Session POC

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) for implementing **Zero Trust session management** across distributed frontend applications. It showcases a stateless, secure, and scalable approach to session validation that supports micro frontends, dynamic modules, and cross-domain environments.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern frontend applications — especially those using micro frontends — often rely on shared cookies, stateful sessions, or implicit trust between modules. These patterns don't scale well and are vulnerable to session replay, leakage, and inconsistent validation.

**Objective:** Demonstrate a secure, Zero Trust model where:
- Each frontend module validates session context independently
- Sessions are bound to device fingerprints or browser metadata
- Tokens are short-lived and revocable
- Validation does not depend on sticky sessions or shared server memory

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

[Login UI] --> [Auth Service] --> Issues Token + Fingerprint | v [Shell App] -----> [Module A] -----+---> Makes API calls with Token + Fingerprint \-> [Module B] -----+---> Backend validates against Redis

[Backend Validator] --> Checks:

Token signature

Expiration

Fingerprint match

Session status from cache (e.g., Redis)


Each module includes the signed session token and device fingerprint in its API requests. The backend independently validates each request without relying on shared sessions or frontend assumptions.

## ✅ Key Features

- **Stateless JWT Tokens**: No server-side session persistence required
- **Device Fingerprint Binding**: Adds client context to each session
- **Redis-Based Validation**: Ensures fast, centralized session lookups
- **Modular Auth Flow**: Each frontend module validates independently
- **Automatic Re-authentication**: Upon token expiry or mismatch

---

## 🔐 Security Principles

- **Zero Trust**: Assume every module, request, and user must prove identity
- **Least Privilege**: Minimize session scope and lifespan
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth, validation, and modules operate independently
- **Audit-Ready**: Every session validated, every decision traceable

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Large-scale SPAs or enterprise dashboards with micro frontends
- Fintech, healthcare, or enterprise platforms needing session hardening
- Cross-domain apps where shared cookies are no longer viable

## 🚧 Status

This project is a **work-in-progress** and is not intended for production use. It's meant as a reference architecture and implementation baseline.
